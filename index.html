  &nbsp;&nbsp;<div style="background-color: lightgreen;">So far CKEditor is my favorite, it supports templates and looks best on mobile. Unfortunately I have not been able to find a good solution for mobile friendly editor, they either do not have features we need, or are super expensive. With templates we can have a more standardized look and feel across all articles, or at least make that easier to do.<br />I tried a few otheres, but they sucked, so I didn't even bother putting them up here.</div>
